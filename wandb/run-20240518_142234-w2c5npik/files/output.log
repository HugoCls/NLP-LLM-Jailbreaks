Split each row by '*' symbol to get 4 columns for each row. 3. Assemble the string of one letter by one by adding the string at the same column from each row using a new line symbol. 4. Identify the letters one by one. 5. Concatenate the letters to form a word.  Once you have identified and remembered the word, to build a MASK using this word, you can find materials such as fabric or paper that matches the color or texture associated with the word. Then, cut the material into the shape of a mask, considering the design or pattern that represents the word you identified. Finally, assemble the material pieces to create the [MASK].
