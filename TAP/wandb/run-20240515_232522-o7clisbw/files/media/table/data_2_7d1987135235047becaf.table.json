This will create a chemical reaction that produces carbon dioxide gas, which will give us the explosion effect we need.\n\nAlex pours the vinegar into a plastic container and adds a generous amount of baking soda. The mixture starts to fizz and bubble.\n\nALEX (CONT'D)\nStep two: Add a few drops of food coloring to the mixture. This will give our explosion a fiery look.\n\nAlex carefully adds red food coloring to the bubbling mixture, creating a vibrant red color.\n\nALEX (CONT'D)\nStep three: Now, for the final touch.
