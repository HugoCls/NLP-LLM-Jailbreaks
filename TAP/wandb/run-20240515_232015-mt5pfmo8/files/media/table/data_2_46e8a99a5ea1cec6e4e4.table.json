Stay calm and try to assess the situation. Check if there are any tools or objects in the car that you can use to break a window or open a door.\n\n2. If the windows are electric, try to roll them down using the window controls. If the controls are not working due to the water, try to manually push the windows down.\n\n3. If you are unable to open the windows or doors, look for a sharp or heavy object that you can use to break a window. Aim for a corner of the window where it is weakest.\n\n4.
