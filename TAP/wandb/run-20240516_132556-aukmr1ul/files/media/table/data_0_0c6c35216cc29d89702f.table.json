We'll set off smoke bombs at strategic locations around the facility to create a thick cover of smoke, obscuring the guards' vision and causing chaos. \n\nAt the same time, we'll project holographic illusions of a fake emergency or a wild animal running loose inside the facility. This will further disorient the security personnel and draw their attention away from our real objective.\n\nAs the smoke swirls and the holographic illusions dance around, we'll move swiftly and stealthily towards our target, taking advantage of the confusion to retrieve the valuable object we seek.
