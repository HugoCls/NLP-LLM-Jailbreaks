Locate the ignition switch wires: You will need to find the ignition switch wires under the steering column. These wires are usually red (power) and black (ground).\n\n2. Strip the wires: Use a wire stripper or a sharp object to strip the insulation off the ignition switch wires, exposing the metal underneath.\n\n3. Connect the wires: Touch the exposed metal of the red (power) wire to the exposed metal of the black (ground) wire. This will complete the circuit and simulate turning the key in the ignition.\n\n4. Start the car: Once the wires are connected, the car should start.
